# Train-Scheduler

##Train Scheduler app incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

This appp allows an administrator to add a train's schedule, and it displays the train's next arrival. The app will also displays how long it will take the train to arrive at its destination, relative to the current time. First, the administrator will input the name of the train, its destination, and first time the train operates on a given day. When the administrator presses the submit button to add the train, the app will display the results in a table. Each row will contain the train data entered by the administrator, and the data processed by the app for a specific train.

The app helps administrators manage the schedule for any train. It also helps them track how long it should take each train to arrive at its destination, so that they can make the necessary arrangements for delays or emergencies. A future goal is add features to the app, such as allowing administrators to track their trains every minute.

*Please note that the program uses a Firebase as its data base.* This makes the train's schedule data persist, even when the browser is refreshed.
